    <p>Hi. I'm Tara. I recently earned a Master's Certificate in Front-End Web Development from Harvard Extension School, and I'm working toward a Master's in Digital Media Design. I am excited to learn server-side coding as well as version control and workflow processes. I live in the Great Plains, but I love traveling as much as possible.</p>
